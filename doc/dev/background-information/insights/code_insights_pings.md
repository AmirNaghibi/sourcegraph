# Code Insights Pings

Code Insights pings allow us to quantitatively measure the usage and success of Code Insights. This page is a source of truth for detailed explanations, statuses, and implementations of our pings. 

We keep this docs page up to date because pings are a vital component of our product knowledge and prioritization process, and a broken or incorrect ping impacts 3-5 months of data (because that's how long a fix takes to propagate). 

## Metrics

### Additions count, edits count, and removals count 

**Functional implementation:** This ping works by diffing settings files, because insight configs are currently stored in settings files. 

**Other considerations:** This is an "imperfect" ping because not all additions + removals directly translate to a new insight or a deleted insight, due to the complications with using settings files as a source of truth. We'll be fixing this when we migrate to a backend database in 3.33.

### Hovers count

**Functional implementation:** This ping works by firing an event on the client when a user hovers over a datapoint on a code insight. 

**Other considerations:** N/A

### UI customizations count


**Functional implementation:** This ping works by firing an event on the client when a user resizes a Code Insights graph on the page. 

**Other considerations:** N/A

- Aggregation: By week 
- Event Code: [InsightUICustomization](https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=context:global+repo:%5Egithub%5C.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph%24+%27InsightUICustomization%27&patternType=literal)

- **Version Added:** 3.25
<!-- - **Known versions broken:** N/A -->

### Data point clicks count

**Functional implementation:** This ping works by firing an event on the client when a user clicks an individual data point of an insight graph, which takes them to a diff search. 

**Other considerations:** Because this functionality does not yet exist for backend insights, it only tracks clicks on frontend insights.

- Event Code: [InsightDataPointClick](

- **Version Added:** 3.25
<!-- - **Known versions broken:** N/A -->

### Page views count

**Functional implementation:** This ping works by firing an event on the client when a user views _any_ /insights page, whether it's creating or viewing insights.  

**Other considerations:** As we add new insights pages it's important to make sure we're adding pages to this counter. 

- Aggregation: By week 
- Event Code: [InsightsPageView](https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=context:global+repo:%5Egithub%5C.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph%24+InsightsPageView&patternType=regexp)

- **Version Added:** 3.25
- **Version(s) broken:** 3.25-3.26 (not weekly)([fix PR](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/20070/files)), 3.30 (broken when switching to dashboard pages, didn't track dashboard views)([fix PR](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/24129/files))

### Unique page views count (weekly)

**Functional implementation:** This ping works by firing an event on the client when a unique user views _any_ /insights page for the first time that week, whether it's creating or viewing insights.  

**Other considerations:** As we add new insights pages it's important to make sure we're adding pages to this counter.
